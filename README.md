Small collection of Home Assistant blueprints for the PTM215Z/ZE and PTM216Z. Those blueprints shall be used with Zigbee2MQTT.

...**(HA)** version are based on the deprecated `sensor.action` and shall not be used with Zigbee2MQTT v2.x.x or later.
There will be an update for the new `event` action when this feature will move from the experimental mode. A **test** folder is now available to test first iterations based on the new `event trigger`.

For any questions or improvement, feel free to open an issue or to post in the Home Assistant forum directly via the links provided below.
